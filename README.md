# techdegree-project6
 This is the sixth project assigned for Treehouse's JavaScript Techdegree Program.

In this project, we create a portfolio site to showcase the projects built throughout the program. The site will contain a landing page, an about page where we'll share our contact info, an elevator pitch and talk a little bit about ourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least the first five projects built for this Techdegree so far. The final result will be deployed on [heroku](https://techdegree-project6.herokuapp.com/){target="_blank"}.

In details, we will:  

* Create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects we've created.

* Use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

We'll use Node.js and Express to:

* Import the required dependencies
* Link the JSON with the Pug templates
* Set up routes to handle requests
* Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
* Handle errors
* Set up a server to serve the project
